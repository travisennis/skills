description: Interrogate complex implementation plans against docs, source, tests, and real constraints before building. Use when Codex needs to surface material unknowns, pressure-test assumptions, clarify domain language, expose unstated user criteria through prototypes or references, prepare a launch packet for agents, or recover from an attempt that failed because it rushed past ambiguity.

# Docs + Unknowns Grill

## Overview

The core idea is:

- **The map** = the prompt, plan, assumptions, skills, prior context, docs excerpts, and the agent's current mental model.
- **The territory** = the real codebase, product constraints, APIs, docs, user taste, deployment environment, and failure modes.
- **Unknowns** = the gap between the map and the territory.

This skill combines docs-grounded grilling, one-question-at-a-time interviewing, domain modeling, and a four-quadrant unknowns pass.

The goal is not to ask endless questions. The goal is to discover the few answers that would materially change the plan (see the **Material** criterion below) — and to write down the shared understanding as it forms.

## When to Use

Use when:

- The user says not to rush implementation, asks for a stronger plan, or wants a rigorous planning pass before orchestrating implementation work.
- The task depends on unfamiliar docs, APIs, libraries, platform behavior, or source conventions.
- The user has a vague product/design desire and likely has **unknown knowns**: they will know good/bad when they see it, but cannot fully specify it upfront.
- The agent is about to spawn subagents or a long-running coding agent and needs a better launch packet.
- A previous attempt failed or is stuck because the agent made assumptions, overfit to generic best practices, or missed real codebase constraints.
- Reviewing a plan/spec/PR where you need to pressure-test hidden assumptions before merge.

Do **not** use when:

- The task is trivial, mechanical, or already has unambiguous acceptance criteria.
- The user explicitly wants immediate execution and the risk of wrong assumptions is low.
- You can verify the right answer directly with a single tool call and no interview is needed.

## Operating Mode

Stay in **Explore** or **Plan** mode until the unknowns that could change the implementation are resolved or explicitly accepted as assumptions.

Default sequence:

1. **Restate the map** — summarize the user's request, the intended outcome, and what is already known.
2. **Read the territory** — inspect the relevant docs/source/tests/config before grilling. Do not rely on vibes if docs or code are available.
3. **Open a grill session ledger** — use `templates/grill-session.md` when the session is complex enough to need a durable working doc.
4. **Build the unknowns ledger** — classify per the Unknowns Taxonomy below.
5. **Build the domain ledger** — identify fuzzy terms, overloaded concepts, vocabulary conflicts, and context boundaries. Use `references/domain-modeling-add-on.md` for `CONTEXT.md` / ADR rules.
6. **Grill one decision at a time** — follow the grill procedure below.
7. **Propose defaults** — for low-risk unknowns, choose a sensible default and label it as an assumption instead of blocking.
8. **Persist shared understanding** — update `CONTEXT.md` for crystallized domain terms and offer ADRs when the Domain Modeling criteria are met.
9. **Create or revise the plan** — see Implementation Plan Requirements below.
10. **Ask for confirmation before build** — do not enact the plan until the user confirms shared understanding, unless they explicitly authorize proceeding with labeled assumptions.
11. **During implementation** — keep implementation notes for deviations and newly discovered unknowns.
12. **Post-implementation** — produce an explainer and quiz/review checklist so the user understands what changed.

## Unknowns Taxonomy

Use this table explicitly in the output when the task is ambiguous enough to justify it.

| Type | Meaning | How to expose it | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Known knowns | Requirements already stated or proven by docs/source | Restate and cite | "Use Stripe Connect; webhook endpoint already exists." |
| Known unknowns | The user/agent knows a decision is unresolved | Ask targeted questions or choose labeled defaults | "Should refunds sync one-way or two-way?" |
| Unknown knowns | The user would recognize the right result when shown, but has not verbalized the criterion | Prototype, sketches, examples, references | "This dashboard feels too enterprise; make it more operator-like." |
| Unknown unknowns | Constraints or possibilities nobody has considered yet | Blindspot pass over docs/source/tests/internet; ask experts; search prior art | "The API rate limit makes this sync architecture impossible." |

## Docs-Grounded Grill Procedure

### 1. Gather evidence first

Before asking the user to decide, inspect available ground truth:

- Official docs for libraries/platforms/APIs.
- Local source files, routes, models, schemas, migrations, tests, and config.
- Existing project conventions and similar implementations.
- Error logs, CI failures, issue comments, PR diffs, or previous implementation notes.
- Reference implementations the user points to, even if in another language.

Fetch missing-but-retrievable docs; if docs cannot be accessed, say so and mark the claim as unverified.

### 2. Convert evidence into pressure-test questions

Good grill questions have all three properties:

- **Material** — the answer could change architecture, scope, UX, data model, security, permissions, or acceptance criteria.
- **Grounded** — the question points to docs/source behavior or a concrete uncertainty, not generic preference fishing.
- **Answerable** — the user can choose from options, approve a default, or supply a reference.

Bad grill questions:

- Obvious preferences that a competent agent can default.
- Exhaustive questionnaires before any research.
- Asking the user to answer things the code/docs can answer.
- Open-ended "anything else?" questions with no context.

### 3. Ask one material question at a time when blocked

If an answer is required to proceed, ask one question, explain why it matters, and give a recommended default. Walk the design tree branch-by-branch — do not dump the whole tree on the user at once.

Template:

```md
Blocking question: <question>
Why it matters: <what changes if answer A vs B>
Evidence: <doc/source/test/reference citation>
Recommended answer: <default + rationale>
If you don't care: I'll proceed with <default>.
```

If multiple questions are useful but not blocking, keep them in the grill queue and ask the next unresolved material decision first.

## Domain Modeling: Shared Language and ADRs

Grilling must also maintain shared language. During the grill, challenge fuzzy or overloaded terms immediately, compare the user's terms against existing `CONTEXT.md`, code identifiers, docs, and product copy, and update `CONTEXT.md` when a term crystallizes (glossary only — no plans, scratchpads, or ADR content).

Offer an ADR only when the decision is (1) hard to reverse, (2) surprising without context, and (3) the result of a real trade-off; otherwise record it in the session/implementation notes. See `references/domain-modeling-add-on.md` for file layout, formats, and examples.

## Finding Unknown Unknowns: Blindspot Pass

Run a blindspot pass when the user is entering an unfamiliar domain, unfamiliar part of the codebase, or high-stakes integration: search the relevant docs/source/tests for unknown unknowns that could materially change the plan, explain them in plain language, rank by implementation risk, and suggest how to resolve each one cheaply.

Output shape:

```md
## Blindspot Pass

### Highest-risk unknown unknowns
1. <unknown>
   - Why it matters:
   - Evidence:
   - Cheap resolution:
   - Decision owner: user / agent / docs / prototype

### Likely safe assumptions
- <assumption> — why safe, how to verify later

### Questions worth asking now
1. <one material question>
```

## Unknown Knowns: Brainstorms, Prototypes, and References

When the user will recognize the right answer visually or behaviorally but cannot fully specify it:

- Build cheap prototypes before wiring real systems — e.g., a single-file mock with fake data showing 3 distinct directions.
- Offer multiple directions with meaningful contrast, not tiny variations.
- Ask the user to react to examples, screenshots, demos, or reference source — e.g., 2-3 similar in-repo modules plus one external reference, then ask which behavior to match.
- Capture the user's reactions as explicit criteria.

## Implementation Plan Requirements

When producing the plan, lead with the decisions most likely to change:

1. **Decision surface** — data model, type interfaces, permissions, user-facing flows, API semantics, migration strategy.
2. **Evidence** — docs/source references that justify the plan.
3. **Open questions** — only material unknowns, ranked by risk.
4. **Resolved assumptions** — low-risk defaults the agent will use unless corrected.
5. **Prototype/reference artifacts** — links or paths if relevant.
6. **Implementation steps** — bite-sized, ordered, with verification gates.
7. **Deviation policy** — what the implementer should do if the territory contradicts the map.

## During Implementation: Notes and Deviations

For complex work, create a temporary implementation notes file such as `implementation-notes.md` or include an equivalent section in the final report. Use `templates/implementation-notes.md` for the minimum sections: plan snapshot, decisions made, deviations, new unknowns, and verification.

Default deviation policy:

- If the issue is low-risk and local, choose the conservative option, log it, and continue.
- If the issue changes architecture, data migration, security, cost, or user-facing behavior, stop and ask.
- If docs contradict the plan, trust the docs/source over the original map and update the plan.

## Post-Implementation: Explain, Pitch, Quiz

After implementation, help the user and reviewers understand the territory discovered during the work.

Deliver:

- What changed and why.
- Which unknowns were resolved.
- Which assumptions remain.
- Docs/source evidence for important behavior.
- Verification results from real commands/tests.
- A short quiz/checklist if the user needs to understand before merge — every quiz item must be answerable from the report itself.

## Subagent / Coding-Agent Launch Packet

Before spawning a subagent or external coding agent, prepare a launch packet from `templates/launch-packet.md`. It covers: goal, map, territory to inspect first, the four unknowns categories, deviation policy, and verification gates.

If using multiple subagents, split roles:

- **Docs scout** — reads official docs/source and returns constraints.
- **Codebase scout** — maps existing patterns and tests.
- **Prototype scout** — creates cheap visual/API alternatives to expose unknown knowns.
- **Implementer** — edits only after the plan is stable enough.
- **Reviewer** — grills the diff against the launch packet and docs.

## Calibration: Over- vs Under-Constraining

- **Too specific**, and the agent follows instructions even when a pivot is better. Define the goal, constraints, and stop/continue rules; leave room for implementation judgment.
- **Too vague**, and the agent defaults to generic best practices that may not fit the product/codebase. Provide references, docs, taste examples, and acceptance criteria.

## Verification Checklist

Before moving from planning to implementation:

- [ ] Relevant docs/source/tests/config were inspected, or the lack of access is stated.
- [ ] Known knowns, known unknowns, unknown knowns, and suspected unknown unknowns are listed.
- [ ] Blocking questions are material and include recommended defaults.
- [ ] Low-risk unknowns are converted into labeled assumptions rather than blocking progress.
- [ ] The plan leads with likely-to-change decisions, not mechanical steps.
- [ ] Deviation policy is explicit for long-running/subagent work.
- [ ] Verification gates are defined before implementation begins.

Before finalizing implementation:

- [ ] Deviations and newly discovered unknowns were logged.
- [ ] Tests/checks/manual verification were actually run and reported.
- [ ] Remaining assumptions are visible.
- [ ] The user/reviewer gets an explainer sufficient to understand the change.
